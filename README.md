## Materials & methods

### MNIST

### EEG data

Data from the published data base created at the Temple University Hospital (TUH), Philadelphia (Obeid & Picone, Frontiers of neuroscience 2016, 10:1-5), was used. One single EEG channel of data from three different folders were used. The sampling frequency was 256 Hz, the duration of extracted data per folder was 20 minutes and the signals were from the F8, A2 and T6 electrode for the respective folder. These contained a periodic discharge (PDI), a cardiac artefact (CA) and a periodic discharge (PDII), respectively. The signals were assessed visually and annotated which resulted in 1106, 1335 and 1133 potentials for the respective signal.
